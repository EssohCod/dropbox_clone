# Welcome to My Dropbox
***

My Dropbox is a web application built using ReactJS and Firebase that mimics the core functionalities of Dropbox. This project focuses on user authentication, file management, and profile customization, providing users with a seamless experience for managing their files in a Dropbox-like environment.



## Task

The main challenge of this project was to create a user-friendly file management system that integrates with Firebase for authentication and storage. The task involved implementing features such as:

    User authentication (sign up, log in, and sign out)
    File upload and deletion
    Profile editing
    File preview and management
    Shared links with encrypted URLs and expiration dates
    Versioning of files
    Handling file operations with proper error handling and permissions


## Description
To solve these challenges, the project utilizes the following technologies and strategies:

    ReactJS: For building the frontend user interface, including components for authentication, file uploads, profile management, and file versioning.

    Firebase: For backend services such as authentication, storage, and real-time database interactions.

    Firebase Storage: For handling file uploads, deletions, and managing file metadata.

    Error Handling: Implemented comprehensive error handling to manage issues such as file not found errors and permission problems.

The application is designed to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience, ensuring that users can easily manage their files, view and edit their profiles, and generate secure shared links.
